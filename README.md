# MiKG4MD
This repository provides the code for MiKG4MD (Microbiota Knowledge Graph for Mental Disorders), a biomedical knowledge graph designed for predicting the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders. This project is done by IBIVU and KR&R group, Verije Universteit Amsterdam. Please refer to our paper "Predicting the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders with knowledge graphs" for more detail which published on Health Information Science and Systems journal. 
# SPARQL
We provide three SPARQL query cases with codes and results. Users can perform their own queries by changing parameters in templates that we designed. We use several abbreviations in the following query codes and results. 'Ref' is an abbreviation for reference. 'Level' refers to the evidence level the reference. 'PMID' is the unique identifier number of a reference in PubMed. Other abbreviations: GM, gut microbiota; NTM, neurotransmitter; MD, mental disorder.
